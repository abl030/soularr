# Cratedigger

A quality-obsessed music acquisition pipeline. Searches Soulseek via [slskd](https://github.com/slskd/slskd), validates downloads against [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/) via [beets](https://beets.io/), and curates a library toward verified lossless sources — automatically.

Cratedigger doesn't just download albums. It siphons the best available quality out of Soulseek over time: downloading, verifying via spectral analysis, converting, comparing against what's already on disk, and re-queuing for upgrades when better sources appear.

> This project was originally inspired by [mrusse/soularr](https://github.com/mrusse/soularr), a clever script that connected Lidarr with Soulseek. Cratedigger has since diverged into its own thing — PostgreSQL pipeline DB, beets validation, spectral quality verification, async downloads, a web UI — but the original idea of bridging Soulseek into a music library workflow came from mrusse's work. Thank you.

## Features

- **PostgreSQL pipeline DB** as the sole source of truth for album requests, download state, and quality history
- **Web UI** (`music.ablz.au`) for browsing a local MusicBrainz mirror and adding albums
- **Beets validation** -- every download validated against the target MusicBrainz release ID before import
- **Auto-import** with FLAC->V0 conversion (or configurable target: Opus, MP3 V2, AAC, FLAC on disk), spectral analysis, and quality gating
- **Async downloads** -- non-blocking: enqueue downloads, persist state to DB, poll on next run. Downloads span multiple 5-minute cycles.
- **Parallel Soulseek searches** -- `ThreadPoolExecutor` fires all searches concurrently
- **Spectral quality verification** -- sox-based transcode detection catches fake FLACs and upsampled MP3s
- **Quality upgrade system** -- automatically re-queues albums when better sources become available. CBR -> lossless -> verified V0.
- **User cooldowns** -- global, temporary cooldowns for Soulseek users who consistently timeout or fail (5 consecutive failures = 3-day cooldown)
- **Force-import** -- manually import rejected downloads via CLI or web API
- **Full audit trail** -- every decision stored as queryable JSONB in PostgreSQL
- **Typed decision pipeline** -- pure functions in `quality.py`, typed dataclasses throughout, pyright enforced
- **Comprehensive test suite** -- 1400+ tests (`nix-shell --run "bash scripts/run_tests.sh"`) with a 4-category taxonomy (pure / seam / orchestration / integration slice), shared `FakePipelineDB`/`FakeSlskdAPI` fakes, builders for typed data, and a route contract audit guard that fails at test time if a new web endpoint is added without frontend contract coverage

## Quality decision pipeline

All quality decisions are pure functions in `lib/quality.py` with full unit test coverage:

1. **`spectral_import_decision()`** -- Pre-import: should we import this CBR download?
2. **`import_quality_decision()`** -- Is this an upgrade or downgrade? Genuine FLAC->V0 always wins.
3. **`transcode_detection()`** -- Post-FLAC-conversion: was the FLAC a transcode?
4. **`quality_gate_decision()`** -- Post-import: accept, or re-queue for better quality?
5. **`determine_verified_lossless()`** -- Single source of truth for verified lossless status.
6. **`should_cooldown()`** -- Global user cooldown: skip users with 5+ consecutive failures for 3 days.

## Tuning the quality rank model

Every threshold, enum, and per-codec band in the rank model is tunable via Nix options on the deployment side. The runtime parses them from `[Quality Ranks]` in `/var/lib/soularr/config.ini`, which is regenerated on every `nixos-rebuild switch` from the Nix module. Full rationale and per-band justification lives in [`docs/quality-ranks.md`](docs/quality-ranks.md); this section is the tuning reference.

### Where to tune

All options live under `homelab.services.soularr.qualityRanks.*` in `nixosconfig/modules/nixos/services/soularr.nix` (separate repo). Edit on doc1 (has git push credentials), commit, push, `nixos-rebuild switch` on doc2. The `[Quality Ranks]` section of `config.ini` is regenerated from these options; Soularr picks up the new values on its next 5-min timer fire.

> **Cross-repo status**: the Nix options are tracked in issue #67. The pin tests and reference values in this README are authoritative on the soularr side; the nixosconfig PR mirrors them verbatim. If you are reading this between the two PRs landing, the options block may not yet exist in `soularr.nix` — in that case, retuning means editing `QualityRankConfig.defaults()` in `lib/quality.py` directly until the Nix side ships.

**Source of truth**: `QualityRankConfig.defaults()` in `lib/quality.py`, pinned by `TestQualityRankConfigDefaults` in `tests/test_quality_decisions.py`. The Nix options mirror those defaults for declarative visibility -- you should be able to open `soularr.nix` and read your current policy without grepping Python. Drift between Python and Nix is caught at soularr test time: bump a default in either repo, the pin test fails and reminds you to update the other.

### Nix-exposed options

**Policy scalars:**

| Option | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gateMinRank` | enum (`unknown`, `poor`, `acceptable`, `good`, `excellent`, `transparent`, `lossless`) | `"excellent"` | Minimum rank an imported album must reach before the quality gate accepts it. Below this → re-queue for upgrade. Raise to tighten (reject more albums); lower to accept lower-quality sources. |
| `bitrateMetric` | enum (`min`, `avg`, `median`) | `"avg"` | Which per-album bitrate statistic feeds rank classification. `avg` is robust to VBR per-track variance. `median` is outlier-resistant -- prefer when albums commonly have quiet intros/hidden tracks/skits that skew `avg`. `min` is legacy and penalizes legitimately-encoded lo-fi VBR. See `docs/quality-ranks.md` "When to prefer median". |
| `withinRankToleranceKbps` | int | `5` | Same-rank equivalence window in kbps. Two bare-codec measurements in the same rank tier within this tolerance are "equivalent"; outside it, one is "better"/"worse". |

**Per-codec band tables** (`bands.<codec>.{transparent,excellent,good,acceptable}`, all in kbps, used when the format hint is a bare codec string like `"MP3"` rather than an explicit label like `"mp3 v0"`):

| Codec | transparent | excellent | good | acceptable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `bands.opus`   | 112 | 88  | 64  | 48  | Unconstrained Opus VBR averages 120-135 kbps typical / 95-150 kbps per track. 112 leaves headroom for sparse material; 88 matches Opus 96 hydrogenaudio quality. |
| `bands.mp3Vbr` | 245 | 210 | 170 | 130 | `excellent=210` preserves the legacy `QUALITY_MIN_BITRATE_KBPS=210` gate threshold. V0 typically averages 220-260; V2 ~190 → `good=170`. **`excellent` also feeds `transcode_detection()` as the spectral-fallback threshold** (#66) so lowering it implicitly lowers what counts as "credible V0" when spectral is unavailable. |
| `bands.mp3Cbr` | 320 | 256 | 192 | 128 | Unverifiable CBR is only `transparent` at 320 because we can't prove a CBR file came from lossless source. Below that → requeue for a FLAC source to re-verify. |
| `bands.aac`    | 192 | 144 | 112 | 80  | Hydrogenaudio consensus places the "no meaningful quality gain above here" ceiling for music at 192 kbps. |

An unmodified `nixosconfig` produces exactly `QualityRankConfig.defaults()` -- the defaults above are the shipping values.

### Collection fields (NOT exposed via Nix -- edit `lib/quality.py` directly)

Three fields are part of the rank model but are NOT surfaced as Nix options because they're rarely-if-ever retuned outside of development. They live on `QualityRankConfig` in `lib/quality.py`, are parseable from `[Quality Ranks]` as CSV (see #65), and default to sensible values. If you want to tune them, the cleanest path is editing the dataclass defaults and updating `TestQualityRankConfigDefaults` to pin the new values. Extending `soularr.nix` to render them is a trivial follow-up if you find yourself retuning them often.

- **`mp3_vbr_levels`** -- 10-tuple mapping LAME V-levels to ranks (V0..V9). The V-level is an **explicit label contract** -- when a download advertises `"mp3 v0"`, the rank model reads V0 from this tuple and bypasses `bands.mp3Vbr` entirely. This is why a 207 kbps lo-fi V0 still classifies as TRANSPARENT: the V0 label beats the 210 threshold.

  **Default ladder**: `V0=TRANSPARENT, V1-V2=EXCELLENT, V3-V4=GOOD, V5-V9=ACCEPTABLE`

  **When to retune**: tighten if you don't trust LAME's claim that V2 is transparent (move V1/V2 to EXCELLENT → GOOD). Loosen if you encode at V4 locally and want your own rips to pass the gate (move V4 up to EXCELLENT).

- **`lossless_codecs`** -- set of codec identity strings that **short-circuit to LOSSLESS** regardless of measured bitrate. Checked against the first whitespace-separated token of the format hint during rank classification. If the format hint starts with any of these, the rank model skips bitrate-based classification entirely and returns LOSSLESS.

  **Default**: `{"flac", "lossless", "alac", "wav"}`

  **When to retune**: add `"ape"`, `"dsf"`, or `"wavpack"` if your library carries them. Remove nothing -- removing entries is a footgun that would reclassify genuine lossless files as UNKNOWN.

- **`mixed_format_precedence`** -- ordered tuple used by `_reduce_album_format()` when an album on disk has tracks in multiple codecs (rare -- usually a manually-merged album). Walked in order; the first codec that appears on the album becomes the album's canonical codec for rank classification. Order matters.

  **Default**: `("mp3", "aac", "opus", "flac")` -- worst codec wins, so a mixed FLAC+MP3 album classifies as MP3 (conservative).

  **When to retune**: reverse to `("flac", "opus", "aac", "mp3")` if you'd rather have mixed-format albums classified by the *best* codec on disk (less conservative -- you'll accept more as "good enough"). The default is the conservative choice for a curated library.

### How to tune and deploy

```bash
# On doc1 (has git push credentials for nixosconfig)
cd ~/nixosconfig
$EDITOR modules/nixos/services/soularr.nix     # tweak qualityRanks.*
git add -p && git commit -m "soularr: retune <what>"
git push
ssh doc2 'sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake github:abl030/nixosconfig#doc2 --refresh'
```

### How to verify the new config is live

1. **Read the generated file** -- `ssh doc2 'sudo cat /var/lib/soularr/config.ini | grep -A 30 "\[Quality Ranks\]"'`. The section should show the exact values from your Nix edit.

2. **Check the runtime picks them up** -- `ssh doc2 'pipeline-cli quality <any_request_id>'`. The output prints the active `gate_min_rank`, `bitrate_metric`, and thresholds the simulator is using. Mismatch means Soularr hasn't restarted since the rebuild (it's a 5-min timer) -- wait a cycle or `sudo systemctl start soularr --no-block`.

3. **Visual confirmation** -- open the [Decisions tab at music.ablz.au](https://music.ablz.au). The top of the tab renders three pills (**Gate min rank** / **Bitrate metric** / **Within-rank tolerance**) pulled from the same `_runtime_rank_config()` snapshot. If your tuning is live, the pills show the new values (#68). The transcode stage rule threshold also reflects `bands.mp3Vbr.excellent` live, since `get_decision_tree()` threads `cfg` through (#75).

### Where the docs live

- [`docs/quality-ranks.md`](docs/quality-ranks.md) -- the full rank model rationale: rank ladder, codec resolution order, band table justification, bitrate metric tradeoffs, when to prefer median.
- [`docs/quality-verification.md`](docs/quality-verification.md) -- spectral cliff detection methodology and tuning history.
- `lib/quality.py:QualityRankConfig` -- the dataclass, with docstrings next to each default.
- `tests/test_quality_decisions.py:TestQualityRankConfigDefaults` -- pin tests that fail loudly on any drift.

## Audit trail

Every download stores two JSONB blobs in `download_log` for complete auditability:

**`import_result`** -- from `import_one.py` via `ImportResult` dataclass:
- Decision (import/downgrade/transcode_upgrade/transcode_downgrade/error)
- Per-track spectral analysis (grade, HF deficit, cliff detection per track)
- Conversion details (FLAC->V0 or configurable target format, post-conversion bitrate)
- Quality comparison (new vs existing bitrate, verified_lossless flag)
- Postflight verification (beets ID, track count, imported path)

**`validation_result`** -- from `beets_validate()` via `ValidationResult` dataclass:
- Full beets candidate list with distance breakdown per component (album, artist, tracks, media, source, year...)
- Track mapping: which local file matched which MusicBrainz track
- Local file list (path, title, bitrate, format) vs MB track list (title, length, track_id)
- Beets recommendation confidence level
- Soulseek username, download folder, failed_path (used by force-import), denylisted users, corrupt files

```sql
-- Why was this rejected?
SELECT validation_result->'candidates'->0->'distance_breakdown',
       import_result->>'decision',
       import_result->'spectral'->>'grade'
FROM download_log WHERE id = <id>;

-- Which tracks matched?
SELECT m->'item'->>'title' as local, m->'track'->>'title' as mb
FROM download_log, jsonb_array_elements(validation_result->'candidates'->0->'mapping') AS m
WHERE id = <id>;
```

All types are fully typed dataclasses with pyright enforcement and JSON round-trip serialization:
`ImportResult`, `ValidationResult`, `CandidateSummary`, `HarnessItem`, `HarnessTrackInfo`, `TrackMapping`, `DownloadInfo`, `SpectralContext`, `AlbumInfo`, `ActiveDownloadState`, `ActiveDownloadFileState`, `CooldownConfig`.

## Pipeline CLI diagnostics

`pipeline-cli` already has the pipeline DB connection configured, so use it for ad-hoc debugging instead of hand-rolling `psql` or Python one-offs.

```bash
# Inline SQL (runs in a read-only DB session)
pipeline-cli query "SELECT id, status, artist_name, album_title FROM album_requests WHERE status = 'wanted' LIMIT 5"

# Multi-line SQL without shell quoting
pipeline-cli query - <<'SQL'
SELECT id, artist_name, album_title, min_bitrate, current_spectral_bitrate
FROM album_requests
WHERE current_spectral_bitrate IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY updated_at DESC
LIMIT 10
SQL

# JSON output for scripting
pipeline-cli query --json "SELECT id, outcome, import_result FROM download_log ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 3"
```

## MusicBrainz mirror

All MusicBrainz lookups hit a local mirror at `http://192.168.1.35:5200` (doc2), not the public API. This avoids rate limits and provides sub-second response times. The mirror runs [musicbrainz-docker](https://github.com/metabrainz/musicbrainz-docker) and replicates nightly.

```bash
# Search releases
curl -s "http://192.168.1.35:5200/ws/2/release?query=artist:radiohead+AND+release:ok+computer&fmt=json"

# Get release with tracks
curl -s "http://192.168.1.35:5200/ws/2/release/<MBID>?inc=recordings+media&fmt=json"
```

## Verified lossless target format

After verifying a FLAC download is genuine (via spectral analysis + V0 conversion), the pipeline can convert to a configurable target format instead of keeping V0. Set in `config.ini`:

```ini
[Beets Validation]
# Target format after verified lossless. Empty = keep V0 (default).
# The V0 conversion always runs first as a verification step.
# Examples: "opus 128", "opus 96", "mp3 v2", "mp3 192", "aac 128"
verified_lossless_target = opus 128
```

Supported formats:

| Config value | ffmpeg codec | Output | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `opus 128` | libopus VBR 128kbps | `.opus` | ~half the bitrate of V0 at equivalent quality |
| `opus 96` | libopus VBR 96kbps | `.opus` | Good for space-constrained libraries |
| `mp3 v0` | LAME VBR quality 0 | `.mp3` | Same as default (no target needed) |
| `mp3 v2` | LAME VBR quality 2 | `.mp3` | ~190kbps, smaller than V0 |
| `mp3 192` | LAME CBR 192kbps | `.mp3` | Fixed bitrate |
| `aac 128` | AAC VBR 128kbps | `.m4a` | Apple ecosystem |
| *(empty)* | *(none)* | `.mp3` | Keep V0 — the default |

The V0 verification step always runs first regardless of target format. Genuineness is judged by `transcode_detection()`: spectral cliff analysis is authoritative when available (suspect grade → transcode, genuine/marginal → not), and the post-conversion V0 bitrate is a fallback only when spectral is unavailable. The fallback threshold defaults to `cfg.mp3_vbr.excellent` (210 kbps) and tracks retuning of `[Quality Ranks]` automatically. Only after verification does the target conversion run from the original FLAC. If the FLAC is a transcode, the target conversion is skipped and V0 is kept.

## Running tests

```bash
nix-shell --run "bash scripts/run_tests.sh"    # full suite, saves to /tmp/soularr-test-output.txt
nix-shell --run "python3 -m unittest tests.<module> -v"  # single module
```

The test layer follows a 4-category taxonomy documented in `.claude/rules/code-quality.md`:

- **Pure function tests** — direct input → output, exhaustive subTest tables for decision matrices
- **Seam tests** — interface boundaries (subprocess argv, route contract fields, SQL shape)
- **Orchestration tests** — assert domain state via `FakePipelineDB`/`FakeSlskdAPI`, not mock call shapes
- **Integration slices** — real code paths in `tests/test_integration_slices.py`, minimal patching, required for every high-risk orchestration boundary

Shared infrastructure lives in `tests/fakes.py` (stateful fakes) and `tests/helpers.py` (typed data builders + the `patch_dispatch_externals()` context manager). New web routes must be classified in `TestRouteContractAudit.CLASSIFIED_ROUTES` — the suite fails at test time if a route is added without contract coverage.

## Deployment

Deployed via NixOS. The NixOS module builds a Python environment with dependencies and runs Cratedigger as a systemd oneshot on a 5-minute timer.

### Schema migrations

Schema lives in `migrations/NNN_name.sql`, applied by a tiny custom migrator (`lib/migrator.py`) that tracks applied versions in a `schema_migrations` table. The deploy systemd unit `soularr-db-migrate.service` (oneshot, `restartIfChanged = true`) runs the migrator on every `nixos-rebuild switch` BEFORE the app services start. `soularr.service` and `soularr-web.service` both `requires` the migrate unit, so a failed migration blocks the app from coming up against an inconsistent schema.

To add a schema change:

1. Drop a new file in `migrations/` named `NNN_describe_change.sql` (next number).
2. Plain SQL — each file runs in its own transaction, exactly once per DB. No `IF NOT EXISTS` guards needed.
3. Test it: `nix-shell --run "python3 -m unittest tests.test_migrator -v"`
4. Commit, push, deploy. The migrator picks it up automatically.

`PipelineDB` itself never runs DDL — it expects the schema to already be current. The migration unit is the only path.
