"""Search query builder for Soulseek.

Builds search queries from artist + album title, applying transforms
to work around Soulseek's server-side search filtering.

Key insight: Soulseek bans certain artist names server-side (Beatles,
AFI, Kanye, etc.). Searches containing banned terms return 0 results.
Replacing the first character with * bypasses the filter:
  "Beatles" → "*eatles" (17786 results vs 0).

We wildcard ALL artist tokens unconditionally — there's no downside
(*ountain matches Mountain) and it avoids needing to maintain a
banned word list.

Pure functions — no I/O, no external dependencies.
